# What is this?
### This is my Senior Project, Last Stand, which I worked on with my team for the semester. It is a 2D, top-down controller game coded in C# using the Unity game engine. The game immerses players in a post-apocalyptic world where they are the last survivor on Earth, battling through mutated infected people in different stages of the COVID virus. Some enemies are fully transformed into big monsters, making them harder to kill. The gameplay is inspired by the zombies mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops, featuring several maps that allow players to experience various environments. The characters are handcrafted using pixel art, and the game features free music sourced online for the sound effects and background music.
